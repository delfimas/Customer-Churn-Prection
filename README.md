# Customer-Churn-Prediction

# Project Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to leave the service and to understand the factors influencing their decision.

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw and processed data.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, modeling, and prediction.
- `src/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, modeling, and prediction.
- `results/`: Contains figures and saved models.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.
- `requirements.txt`: Required Python packages.
- `LICENSE`: Project license.

## Notebooks
1. **Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, feature engineering, and data transformation.
2. **Modeling**: Model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.
3. **Prediction**: Making predictions on new data and evaluating model performance.
